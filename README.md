# Computational-Cognitive-Science

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of computational cognitive science models. The models and analysis have been implemented in Python using the following libraries: Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, PIL, time and seaborn. All of the above was done as a part of the CS786-Computational Cognitive Science course instructed by Prof Nisheeth Srivastava at IIT Kanpur (Spring-2020). 

## [Assignment - 1](/CS786-Assignment-1-Noteboook.ipynb)  

Contains the implementation and analysis of:  
 
a) Data  
&emsp;	i) [MNIST](https://gitlab.com/datapythonista/mnist) (converted to be compatible with the Hopfield Network)
b) Model  
&emsp;	i) Hopfield network   
c) Evaluation  
&emsp;	i) cue informativeness   
&emsp;	ii) number of other patterns stored in the network   
&emsp;	iii) network size  
d) Performance  
&emsp;	i) F-score  

## [Assignment - 2](CS786-Assignment-2-Noteboook.ipynb)  

Contains the implementation and analysis of:  

i) Neural network classification of boolean functions  
ii) Q-learning in a Frozen Lake environment  
iii) Rulkov map for signal classification
